# JARVIS-AI-Chatbot
With Flask and OpenAI's API, I developed an AI Chatbot for voice I/O. Fueled by a Python
backend, it ensures strong logic and data processing. The HTML/CSS-designed frontend
enriches the user experience. The chatbot stands out in its multilingual ability. It can
fluently switch languages upon request, offering seamless cross-lingual communication.
This integration promises a user-friendly experience, showcasing the blend of technology
and language diversity.
